  text: 'I am using "Future App" over 3 months. from 2021, March onwards lockdown was been started. And I had started my school through Future application May 2021 onwards. Me, our teachers, our students, our guardians, our Account section, Our Management never sense that we are working from home. Everything is obtainable in this application. Accounts, Teaching, Examination, Video classes, Attendance, Academic grade, Practise session, Routine, Roaster, Class Teacher, Auto promotion and many more. I have a little experience of 23 years, but this is the first time I have seen this kind of complete package in a single application. I really grateful to all the members of "Future App" for making me feel working in a school while I had functioned from home.
The more important is the SERVICE after sale. In this respect, I am the gladdest individual as I have got each and every service as per my requirement, as per system requirement. Whenever system needs updating and purgation it has been done without asking any question and within the time frame. FUTURE APP deserves to be in every school to get the flavor of originality of work being in home or offline. This can be use while the school got open also. I believe, FUTURE App can do only good for the school. All the best.'
